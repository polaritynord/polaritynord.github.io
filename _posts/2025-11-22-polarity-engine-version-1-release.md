### [View the repository from here!](https://github.com/polaritynord/polarity-engine)

Back with another post here, to announce that Polarity Engine is now available as a separate repository for anyone to use! It's built on top of Love2D, and serves as a "collection" of useful features and functions to start making 2D games easily and quickly, while also keeping things tidy.

To use it, you can simply download the latest release (or the version you want to use, though only one exists as of now) from the releases page and start modifying the _game_ directory. I know that this does not really tell you how to really use the game engine and how it works, but writing a documentation for this will have to be done later. Here is my current todo list:

* DESOLATION version 1.6
* Polarity Engine example projects and documentation
* Improvements to this website
* Upcoming game jam
